= Stopping a Cluster

To stop your cluster, stop the components in the reversed order from starting it:

* Stop WilFly/jBPM Server

Either use the stop shell scripts, or Ctrl + c.

NOTE: Two servers need to stop accordingly.

ps aux|grep HelixControllerMain
kill -15 <pid of HelixControllerMain>
----

* Stop ZooKeeper server(s).

[source,shell]
